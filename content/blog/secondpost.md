## Learning Eleventy
This week I've learned some basics on how to use Eleventy to create a blog.

This was my first time working on a project using a lot of files and even more importantly a lot of files using languages I am not familiar with.

.md files and .njk files are totally new to me so I began trying to decipher how they worked and communicated with the other files in the project.

- I've googled keywords.
- I've asked AI what specific code does.
- I've tried to break it down for myself first.
- After getting an idea of what it meant I tried testing changing code to see the effects.
- I've just learned that you can use the '-' key to create a bullet point
