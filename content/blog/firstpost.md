I've given myself the challenge of sharing my progress in web development every week. 

Here's the website I worked on this week - [Packer's Provisions](https://piigiipii.github.io/)

It is the start to a website I will be developing for my Dad who makes South African food products.

What I've learned this week:
How to implement bootstrap components and utilities.
How to use bootstrap to make a webpage responsive.
How to create a sticky nav-bar.
How to use flex-grow.
How to use the command line to interact with github.
How to use github to host a live site.

Challenges:
I wanted a striking image and the title of the page to appear over the whole screen when opening the webpage which the user would scroll past to find out more information or would use the nav to quickly jump past. I started out by setting the element to 100vh, but realised that the nav was taking up some of the space too. I've started using AI to support me in finding solutions to these problems which pointed me towards using flex-grow. I already have some understanding of how flex works and I was able to solve the problem. 

Another problem I was having was that my elements were taking up more space than the width of the viewport. I identified this was due to the contact information not wrapping on to the next line. I found an acceptable solution which was to assign a font-size which is sized relative to the screen
